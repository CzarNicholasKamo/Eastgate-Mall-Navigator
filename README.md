# Eastgate-Mall-Navigator
This is a prototype I’m building to solve a simple problem: finding shops in Eastgate without wandering around. It's currently in the early stages, focusing on the core logic of getting directions from entrances to a few specific stores.

Current Status
I’ve been away from GitHub for 6 months and recently cleared my old repos. I'm using this project to get back into a habitual coding rhythm.

What works right now:

Basic direction lookup for about 6 stores.

A UI that matches somewhat the Eastgate brand colors.

Simple fade-in animations for the results.

What I'm working on next:

Adding more shop data.

Implementing a "Clear" button to reset the UI.

Potentially adding a "Map View" toggle to show floor plans.

Tech
Plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

No heavy frameworks yet—just focusing on clean Vanilla JS logic.
